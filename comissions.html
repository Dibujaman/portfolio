            <h1>Neo y el poder del Vitae - Young teen novel</h1>

            <p class="graytext2">This was my first ever time illustrating a book, and the experience was intense and fun in equal amounts. A lot of drawings were needed in little time, and with a style different to my usual cartoonish characters. At times I would skip a few meals in order to get my schoolwork and my freelance work going forward. Luckily I manage my workload better now.<br>I am not allowed to show a lot, but here are our main characters and the book cover!</p>

              <h1>El vendedor de ilusiones - Kids book</h1>

              <p class="graytext2">This was now my second time illustrating a book. This time around, the amount of drawings was minor, but the time was less.<br>Due to the story the book follows, the drawings start very gray and pale, and slowly gain more color as the story advances, which was very fun to do, and it allowed me to merge two styles I liked (somber and cute) in the illustrations.<br>Again, I cannot show a lot, but here is the cover and two of the illustrations from the book!</p>
