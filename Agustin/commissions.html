                <p class="graytext2">As a teenager, around the age of 16, I started to offer my artistic skills as a freelancer in several websites.<br>During my years of handling comissions I practices different styles, techniques and even transitioned through different digital programs.<br>And while I cannot say I am proud of my earnings during that time, I can say I am very proud of the work I developed on each new project. So here they are! </p>

            <p class="graytext2">This was my first ever time illustrating a book, and the experience was intense and fun in equal amounts. A lot of drawings were needed in little time, and with a style different to my usual cartoonish characters. At times I would skip a few meals in order to get my schoolwork and my freelance work going forward. Luckily I manage my workload better now.<br>I am not allowed to show a lot, but here are our main characters and the book cover!</p>

              <p class="graytext2">This was now my second time illustrating a book. This time around, the amount of drawings was minor, but the time was less.<br>Due to the story the book follows, the drawings start very gray and pale, and slowly gain more color as the story advances, which was very fun to do, and it allowed me to merge two styles I liked (somber and cute) in the illustrations.<br>Again, I cannot show a lot, but here is the cover and two of the illustrations from the book!</p>

            <h1>Twitch Animations</h1>

            <p class="graytext2">During the last few years, I have met my fair share of Twitch streamers, mostly people that love playing games and enjoy to do so while livestreaming.<br>Some of them requested me to create some short animations for when they get a new subscriber. This works as a means to announce and celebrate that they are being supported, which is why cartoony and funny animations work very nicely, and of course, it's one of my favorite things to do!<br>Here are two samples of subscriber animations I have created for some Twitch channels!</p>

          <h1>Animation Sprites</h1>

          <p class="graytext2">I had done animations many times, simple ones, just for fun. But when I was approached by a group of friends that wanted to do animations, and wanted me to illustrate the sprites for them, I couldn't avoid but to be excited.<br>They needed many characters in many angles, and it was ina style I had never experimented with before (Family Guy's style). This was a whole new challenge.<br>Sadly, I had to drop the project midway through to fully focus on my university projects.<br>Here are some of the characters I created for them!</p>

        <h1>Toons For The Speakers - TEDx Collaboration</h1>

      <p class="graytext2">I consider myself to work much, much better when under great pressure. So when a friend of mine recommended me to a TEDx organizer, who reached out to me to request some last minute drawings, I got excited!<br>I had less than two days in order to illustrate 12 different speakers, which would be exposed during each of the speaker's talks. The drawings needed little detail and had to be done fast.<br>After finishing and sending all of the drawings, I got invited to the event to participate in a small activity, where I would sketch the participant's concepts in a whiteboard live. It was super fun, and I got a T-shirt!<br>Here are all of the drawings of the speakers of the TEDx talk!</p>

        <h1>Minecraft Server Logo</h1>

        <p class="graytext2">Very rarely am I asked to do anything similar to logos. My strenght is definitely cartoons, I put a ton of details in things and logos are not really about that, they are mostly simplistic. So when I was asked to do a logo for a Minecraft server, I had a challenge ahead.<br>I love the game, and had many concepta in mind, tried them all out, and chose my favorite. Again, I probably did too much detail for a logo that is mean to be simpler, which is why I made a minimalistic version of it. The detailed one is still my favorite anyways...<br>Here are both the detailed and simplistic logos for ArTec, survival multiplayer Minecraft server!</p>
